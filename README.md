# gogon — Polymarket Auto-Trading Bot

An automated trading bot for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) built on
Polymarket's official CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) API. It scans active
markets, applies pluggable strategies, and executes trades through a risk
manager with hard position/exposure/loss caps.

> ⚠️ **This is trading software. It can lose real money.** Read the whole
> README, run in paper mode first, and never risk more than you can afford
> to lose. Nothing here is financial advice.

## How it works

```
main loop
  ├─ market_data: scans active markets from the CLOB API
  ├─ strategies:  turn order-book data into buy/sell Signals
  │    ├─ arbitrage  (default, ON)  — buy YES+NO when combined price < $1
  │    └─ threshold  (default, OFF) — mean-reversion on price swings
  ├─ risk:        approves/rejects each Signal against position & loss caps
  └─ execution:   simulates the fill (paper) or signs & submits an order (live)
```

Every signal, filled or not, is appended to `data/trades.csv` as an audit
trail. Logs go to the console and to `logs/bot.log` (rotating).

### Why arbitrage is the default strategy

A binary Polymarket market always pays exactly $1 to the winning outcome's
shares and $0 to the losing side. Buying **one YES share and one NO share**
therefore always resolves to exactly $1 combined, no matter which side wins.
If the combined ask price of YES + NO is reliably below `$1 - fees`, the gap
is close to risk-free profit at resolution. The real risks are execution
risk (one leg fills, the other doesn't — mitigated here by using
fill-or-kill orders) and Polymarket's own fee/rule changes — which is why
`min_edge` and `fee_buffer` exist as safety margins in the config.

The threshold (mean-reversion) strategy is included as a second option but
ships **disabled**, because it's directional and can lose money in a
trending market — only turn it on if you understand that risk.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
- Leave `LIVE_TRADING=false` to run in **paper trading** (fully simulated,
  no funds at risk, no wallet required). This is the default and the
  recommended starting point.
- To go live later, you'll need:
  - `POLY_PRIVATE_KEY` — the private key of the wallet that signs orders.
    **Never commit this or paste it anywhere outside your local `.env`.**
  - `POLY_FUNDER_ADDRESS` — the address holding your USDC. If you trade
    through the polymarket.com website, this is your **proxy wallet**
    address (shown on your Polymarket profile), and `POLY_SIGNATURE_TYPE`
    should be `2`. If you trade with a plain EOA wallet directly, use your
    wallet address and `POLY_SIGNATURE_TYPE=0`.
  - Then set `LIVE_TRADING=true`.

Tune strategy and risk parameters in `config/settings.yaml` — in
particular `risk.max_position_usd`, `risk.max_total_exposure_usd`, and
`risk.max_daily_loss_usd`. Start small.

## Running

```bash
# Sanity-check config, wallet, and connectivity before running for real:
python scripts/check_setup.py

# Run the bot:
python -m bot.main
```

Stop any time with `Ctrl+C` — it finishes the current cycle and exits
cleanly.

## Dashboard

A local, read-only dashboard shows live trading activity — KPIs, cumulative
volume chart, strategy breakdown, open positions, and recent trades — read
straight from `data/trades.csv`. No extra dependencies, nothing leaves your
machine.

```bash
# in a second terminal, alongside `python -m bot.main`:
python scripts/dashboard.py
```

It opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser automatically and
refreshes every 5 seconds.

## Running tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Tests cover the pure logic (risk limits, arbitrage sizing/edge detection,
threshold signal generation) with no network calls, so they're safe and
fast to run anytime.

## Safety notes

- **Start in paper mode** and watch `data/trades.csv` / `logs/bot.log` for
  at least a few days before considering live trading.
- **Start with small caps** in `config/settings.yaml` when you do go live.
- The bot enforces a **daily loss kill-switch** (`risk.max_daily_loss_usd`):
  once hit, it stops opening new positions until UTC midnight. It does not
  automatically close existing positions for you.
- In live mode, order fills are tracked based on the CLOB API's response to
  each order submission. Periodically reconcile against
  `client.get_trades()` / the Polymarket UI — don't rely solely on the
  bot's in-memory position tracking for anything you haven't verified.
- The arbitrage strategy currently only handles simple **binary
  (two-outcome)** markets.
- This code has not been run against the live Polymarket API from this
  environment (no network access here) — treat `scripts/check_setup.py`
  as your first real-world check, and review the code yourself before
  trusting it with funds.
